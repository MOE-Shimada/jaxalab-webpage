        <h3>Verification method for robustness</h3>
        <p>We research and develop the assurance methods for verification completeness, and the key technologies for
          robustness verification including the non-functional specifications.</p>
        <h3>Automated verification method</h3>
        <p>We first research on the analysis of system configuration, operational conditions and system error pattern
          models. Based on those concepts, algorithms and methodologies for the automated generation of verification
          cases and the automated success criteria of verification results will be developed.</p>

        <h3>Assurance method for verification completeness</h3>
        <p>We research technology to evaluate verification completeness of whole End-to-End software systems based on
          verification information produced by various software systems.</p>
        <h3>Assurance method for defect propagation</h3>

        <h2>Explication and evaluation of general safety requirements using Goal Structuring Notation</h2><br>
        <p>Safety requirements for a specific system domain like general safety require-
          ments and safety standards tend to have obscure and ambiguous descriptions.
          Misinterpretations of them can cause excessively redundant, or just deficient
          safety design, which can be a trigger of cost escalation or an accident as a
          worst case. In this research, we focus on implicit assumptions as a root of am-
          biguousness mentioned above and propose a method to explicate an article in
          general safety requirements aiming for mutual understanding among stakehold-
          ers and improving system safety. The target of our research is Computer-Based
          Control System (CBCS) safety requirements, which are a safety standard for
          spacecraft systems and explication in our method is carried out by means of
          Goal Structuring Notation (GSN). In order to evaluate our proposal in a quan-
          titative way, we performed a comparative experiment with the help of Japan
          Aerospace eXploration Agency's engineers. The result of the experiment shows
          that GSN-based CBCS safety requirements, which are obtained by our method,
          are more effective to detect and correct errors in a given document on system
          safety than usual safety requirements written in natural language. Moreover,
          by analyzing correlative relationship between the two results obtained by the
          experiment and by the interview to the examinees, we conclude that GSN-based
          CBCS safety requirements can reduce misunderstandings among developers of
          a system and certifiers for safety.</p>

        <h2>Orthogonal Defect Classification for Spacecraft Software and its application for Verification Strategy </h2>
        <br>
        <p> Many countries besides Japan develop outer space technology such as artificial satellites. But insignificant
          software anomalies, complex component errors, and a lack of assumptions on the part of developers often cause
          utter project failures, e.g. Ariane 5 and the Mars Climate Orbiter. Reasons for such failures include the
          reuse of legacy systems and software development process problems. Independent Verification and Validation
          (IV&V) is one way of reducing the risks, with verification and validation done by independent organizations
          and through outside funding. Conversely, this method is confronted with many difficulties because it depends
          on manpower. Such difficulties include inconsistencies between systems, increased workloads, quality
          dependence for engineers, and know-how succession. Computer-aided verification is said to be an effective way
          of solving this problem if verification quality can be assured.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of this research is to reveal better software verification strategies by
          using anomalies that are produced in spacecraft onboard software development projects. Orthogonal Defect
          Classification (ODC) is a defect classification method developed by Ram Chillarege. It uses quality analysis
          (e.g. HAZOP) and quantity analysis (e.g. FTA) aspects and can completely solve software problems by analyzing
          defect tendencies from defect characters and their respective numbers. ODC is widely used in industry fields
          because it does not depend on specific technology or a specific software development process.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose improving this method for spacecraft onboard software to more accurately classify
          anomalies to establish a procedure for validation. We then apply our improved method to fifty anomalies from
          five spacecraft projects by using a root causal analysis method for ODC called Deep Dive for spacecraft
          software, which reveals root causes of and tendencies for problems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;We suppose that utilizing
          Software in Loop Simulation (SILS) and Hardware in Loop Simulation (HILS) for test optimization can improve
          the problem that spacecraft onboard software development has according to the defect analysis results.
          Simulations can run be used in early phase because they do not need hardware. They help to find more anomalies
          before System Test phase. Simulations can reduce testing cost because these can perform faster than real-time
          simulations and tests. Moreover, these are used in some spacecraft onboard software developments. However, it
          takes enormous time to
          construct a scenario-based test case because these are made by professionals. We think that a scenario-based
          test case input generation can solve this problem by improving comprehensiveness while reducing costs. </p>

        <h2>Risk Analysis of Scenarios based on STAMP/STPA Using Statistical Model Checking</h2><br>
        <p>STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) is an accident model that can capture hazards caused
          without components faults but inconsistency among subjective recognitions of involving components, systems or
          human beings. Especially for modern complex systems like software-intensive systems, systems of systems (SoS),
          cyber-physical systems (CPS), machine learning application systems, such type of accidents is one of the main
          area of concerns in the context of risk management.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a method to analyze hazards based on STAMP.
          In contrast to traditional hazard analysis techniques like FMEA (failure mode and effect analysis), FTA (fault
          tree analysis), ETA (event tree analysis), and HAZOP, STPA is being expected to be used for analyzing hazards
          of modern complex systems like autonomous driving vehicles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Among the traditional techniques, using FTA and ETA, the cause-effect relations from the events and conditions
          that are the triggers, e.g. faults of components or environmental conditions, of the hazard to the final event
          involving harm or an accident can be analyzed and described. In addition, associating probability to each
          triggering event and condition we can obtain probability of the target hazard and can evaluate the associated
          risk. On the other hand, STPA does not include risk assessment, i.e., activities for calculating and
          evaluating risks, including prioritizing hazardous scenarios, are outside the scope. Moreover, hazardous
          scenarios obtained by STPA based on the accident model STAMP are difficult to dealt with by FTA or ETA,
          because these techniques do not allow to analyze dynamic interactions between components.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In order to cope with such situation, we propose a method to analyze risk analysis for hazardous scenarios
          obtained by STPA with the help of statistical model-checking. More precisely, to calculate probability of
          hazardous scenarios with statistical model-checking, we give a systematic translation procedure from the
          result of STAMP/STPA activities to formal models for a statistical model-checking tool Uppaal SMC. We also
          show a case study of our proposed method applying to a railroad crossing system. As a result, we could obtain
          probability of some example hazardous scenarios through formally modeling the artifacts from STAMP/STPA and
          then evaluate the risks.</p>
